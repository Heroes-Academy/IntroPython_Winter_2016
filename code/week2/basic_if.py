"""
Practice the If statement below

I have described three different if-statement situations.

The first requires just an if.
The second requires an if and an else.
The third requires if, elif, and else.

If you forget how to write them, please ask me or refer to the slides.
"""

#### if and only if
# write an if statement that checks if a variable representing temp is higher than 90
# if it is higher than 90, print a message about it being hot


#### if and an else
# write an if statement that checks if a variable representing temp is lower than 40
# if it is, print a message about it being cold
# if it isn't, (aka, using an 'else'), then print a message about it not being cold

#### if, elif, and else
# combine the above two
# test if it is above 90 with the if, if it is, print the message from the first part
# test if it is below 40 with an elif, if it is, print the message from the second part
# if both of those ifs are False, then the else will be used
# so, if the else is used, then print out a message about it not being too hot or cold
