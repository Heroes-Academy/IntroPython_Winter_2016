Week 8: Advanced Classes
========================


Summary
-------

Today we covered more advanced classes.  We went through and collaboratively built a class for representing things in the world.

Next, the `__init__` function for classes was introduced.  This is a tough concept to master, but we worked through several examples and had the rest of the class time dedicated to see it in practice. 


Homework
--------

There are a couple homework options in the slides.  You can either improve upon the Turtle Artist class that we created, or you can create a new class to represent sets of things.  We discussed in class so you should know what you'd like to do.
