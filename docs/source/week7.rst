Week 7: Advanced Functions and Basic Classes
============================================

-------

Last week we looked at the basics of functions and how they can take different arguments.

This week, we covered functions that can return values. We talked about the simplest class: one that can hold two variables.  This class, the `Point` class, was used to make a turtle move by storing several coordinates.  We also wrote a function for making a new Point object by taking as input some values. 

Finally, basic classes were introduced.  We went through the perspective that the entire world is functions and objects.  The goal is to understand classes as representing things in the world. 

Homework
--------

Write classes for two things in the world. It should be very similar to the Dog class that is in the slides.
