Week 3: Turtles
===============

Summary
^^^^^^^

Last week we had a snow storm!  Class was not in session.

So, before next week, I would like you all to play with turtles!  Hopefully you've had a chance to get Python installed at home.  If you haven't, you should do so now.  If you have troubles, email me immediately.

Go over the slides below and follow along with the slides.  You should type the commands into the interactive console.  (Note: if the iPython QT Console freezes, try tying '%gui tk' in to the console before you do any turtle things).

I have also included a couple of interactive online code demos.  You can see them below.


Homework
^^^^^^^^

Play with turtles!  Before we meet next week, you should be able to draw at least one of the following:

1. A face
2. Your name
3. A star

Extra Resources
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

The following things are called "trinkets".  They are interactive python windows.  You can run them and edit the code.  For playing around, I would recommend click on the menu for each (the 3 lines on the top left) and clicked "full screen".  This will make things look much better.

For each of the following turtles, there is a theme!  Play around with each of them.  I named my turtle Bob, but you can name it whatever you want =).
