Week 5: Loops
=============


Summary
-------

Because the snowstorm had still set us back, we started with a refresher of container types.
We then covered lists in depth while briefly covering dictionaries, sets, and tuples.

We talked about how strings are treated as lists when it comes to indexing and slicing.
Finally, we introduced `while` loops and talked about how conditions are handled by the while.

Homework
--------

1. From week 4's slides (the last slide):
    - tell the user you are making a list.
    - ask them for the number of items and loop that many times using a for loop
    - During each loop iteration, ask them for an item and add it to a list
    - See the slides for other details
2. Work on the dice_rolls.py.
    - It is found in the github repository in the code/week5 folder.
        + You can find it by clicking "edit on github" above or by `clicking here <https://github.com/Heroes-Academy/IntroPython_Winter_2016>`_.
    - Email me if you have questions
