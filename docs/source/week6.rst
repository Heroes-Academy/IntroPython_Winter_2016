Week 6: Basic Functions
=======================

Summary
-------

Today, we covered basic functions.
Functions let us package code so we can reuse it over and over!
We covered the following topics:

  - the syntax of a function
  - passing data into a function
  - the messy parts of the syntax and what to watch out for


Homework
--------

For this week, you should make the following turtle functions.

1. spiral
  - the first argument should be the turtle
  - the additional arguments should be the angle and the number loop iterations
2. polygon
  - the first argument should be the turtle
  - the additional arguments should be side length and number of sides
3. jump
  - the first argument should be the turtle
  - the additional arguments should be the new position (x and y)
  - the turtle should not draw while jumping

For bonus, you can do the following:

1. draw_letter
  - the first argument should be the turtle
  - the additional argument could be size, or it could draw one size
  - you should have a different function for different letters
2. draw_word
  - use the draw_letter functions and the jump function to write a word
3. Complete the bonus exercise at the end of the slides.  There are two parts:
    1. Make the functions that it calls so that the code will run
    2. Change the control numbers into variables and turn it into a function
