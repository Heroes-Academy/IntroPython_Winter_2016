Week 6: Basic Functions
=======================


Summary
-------

Functions allow you to chunk code into bigger pieces that make writing programs easier.
In this class, we go over how simple functions work.
Functions are first defined, and then in later code, they are called.
Defining a function is not the same thing as calling or executing the function.

Functions are named.  They use parenthesis at the end of their name to tell the
Python interpreter to execute the function.

We also cover the basics of arguments.  Arguments allow us to send information into the function.
We send the information by putting variables inside the parenthesis.
Multiple arguments are separated by commas.


Homework
--------

1. Write functions for the following turtle abilities:
  - spirals
    - We did these in class, this should give you a good starting point
  - polygons
    - the turning angle should always be 360 / num_sides
    - Sum of exterior angles always equals 360
  - jumping
    - set the turtle’s pen to up (so it doesn’t draw), then do setpos on an x and y coordinate, then put the pen back down
  - drawing each letter of your initials
    - you could do more letters if you want to spell your name
  - a function that uses the letter drawing and jumping to draw both initials or to write a word
2. Turn your code from week 5 into functions
  - Each individual exercise should be a function
  - Doing this, you can change which code runs just by changing which function is called.
